# LightUpTheNewWorld-StringHandling : chapter 2 String constant pools

String constant pools are language-specific features that exist in Java and Python but not in C++ or TypeScript. Below, I'll provide explanations and examples for string constant pools in Java and Python.

## Java
In Java, there is a special area in memory called the "string constant pool," which is a pool of unique string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks if it already exists in the pool. If it does, the existing string is reused instead of creating a new one. This can save memory and improve performance.
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "Hello";  // "Hello" is placed in the string constant pool
        String str2 = "Hello"; // Reuses the existing "Hello" from the poo
        String str3 = new String("Hello"); // Creates a new string object (not in the pool)

        System.out.println(str1 == str2); // true (both point to the same "Hello" in the pool)
        System.out.println(str1 == str3); // false (str3 is a new object)
    }
}
```

## Python
In Python, there is also a feature similar to a string constant pool, called string interning. String interning is the process of storing only one copy of each unique string value in memory, and any references to the same value point to that single copy.
```java
str1 = "Hello"  # "Hello" is interned
str2 = "Hello"  # Reuses the interned "Hello"

print(str1 is str2)  # True (both variables reference the same interned "Hello")
```

It's important to note that C++ and TypeScript do not have built-in string constant pools like Java or Python. In C++, you manage strings using standard library containers like std::string, and in TypeScript, strings are treated as regular objects without interning or a constant pool mechanism.
